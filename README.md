# Hardwired

Hardwired is a complete overhaul mod for the electrical system in Stationeers, replacing it with a more realistic system with voltage, current, inductance, capacitance, resistance, etc, that follow real-world physics and equations.

The overall goal is to make the electrical system in Stationeers have a similar level of complexity and realism as the atmospherics or other systems, requiring the player to think through their designs and learn real electrical concepts.

⚠️ This mod is still a work-in-progress. Most features have not yet been added, or are incomplete. ⚠️

## Features

The following features are planned or are in progress:

- [ ] Add a realistic electrical physics simulation
  - [ ] Voltage, Current, Resistance (Ohm's Law)
  - [ ] Non-linear effects (Inductance, Capacitance, etc)
- [ ] Add resistive heating to cables (cables will heat up based on resistance and current flow)
  - [ ] Burn-out cables based on temperature rather than instantaneous power draw
- [ ] Add AC to physics simulation
  - [ ] AC Voltage & Current, Phase
  - [ ] Impedence, Reactance
- [ ] Add new components
  - [ ] Transformers
  - [ ] AC/DC converters (inverter, rectifier, etc)
    - Still TBD if I will keep DC circuits once AC is simulated properly, or if all devices will be AC for simplicity
  - [ ] Synchroscope
- [ ] Add more complex power generation mechanics
  - Different generators might generate electricity at different voltages, or at different AC frequencies, etc
